            <h4>The Miser</h4>
            <h5>ACT IV:
                This play was acted for the first time on September 9, 1668. In it,
                Molière has borrowed from Plautus, and has imitated several other
                authors, but he far surpasses them in the treatment of his subject.
                The picture of the miser, in whom love of money takes the place of all
                natural affections, who not only withdraws from family intercourse,
                but considers his children as natural enemies, is finely drawn, and
                renders Molière's Miser altogether more dramatic and moral than those
                of his predecessors.
            </h5>

 MAR. Alas! Is it in my power to take any resolution? And, dependent as
I am, can I do anything else except form wishes?

CLE. No other support for me in your heart? Nothing but mere wishes?
No pitying energy? No kindly relief? No active affection?

MAR. What am I to say to you? Put yourself in my place, and judge what
I can possibly do. Advise me, dispose of me, I trust myself entirely
to you, for I am sure that you will never ask of me anything but what
is modest and seemly.

CLE. Alas! to what do you reduce me when you wish me to be guided
entirely by feelings of strict duty and of scrupulous propriety.

MAR. But what would you have me do? Even if I were, for you, to divest
myself of the many scruples which our sex imposes on us, I have too
much regard for my mother, who has brought me up with great
tenderness, for me to give her any cause of sorrow. Do all you can
with her. Strive to win her. I give you leave to say and do all you
wish; and if anything depends upon her knowing the true state of my
feelings, by all means tell her what they are; indeed I will do it
myself if necessary.

CLE. Frosine, dear Frosine, will you not help us?

FRO. Indeed, I should like to do so, as you know. I am not naturally
unkind. Heaven has not given me a heart of flint, and I feel but too
ready to help when I see young people loving each other in all
earnestness and honesty. What can we do in this case?

CLE. Try and think a little.

MAR. Advise us.
