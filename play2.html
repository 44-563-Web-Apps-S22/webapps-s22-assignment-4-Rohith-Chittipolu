    <h4>ELI.</h4> <p class="speech ELI">Invent something to undo what you have done.</p>

    <h4>FRO.</h4><p class="speech FRO"> Rather a difficult piece of business. (_To_ MARIANNE) As far as
    your mother is concerned, she is not altogether unreasonable and we
    might succeed in making her give to the son the gift she reserved for
    the father. <p class="direction">(_To_ CLÃ‰ANTE)</p> But the most disheartening part of it all
    is that your father is your father.</p>
    
    <h4>CLE.</h4> <p class="speech CLE">Yes, so it is.</p>
    
    <h4>FRO.</h4> <p class="speech FRO">I mean that he will bear malice if he sees that he is refused,
    and he will be in no way disposed afterwards to give his consent to
    your marriage. It would be well if the refusal could be made to come
    from him, and you ought to try by some means or other to make him
    dislike you, Marianne.</p>
