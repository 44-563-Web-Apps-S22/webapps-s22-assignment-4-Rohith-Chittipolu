            <h3 class="name">ACT IV: Play with MAR,CLE,FRO.
            </h3>
            
            <p>

                <h4 >MAR.</h4><p class="speech MAR"> Alas! Is it in my power to take any resolution? And, dependent as
                I am, can I do anything else except form wishes?</p>
                
                <h4 > CLE.</h4> <p class="speech CLE">No other support for me in your heart? Nothing but mere wishes?
                No pitying energy? No kindly relief? No active affection?</p>
                
                <h4 > MAR.</h4><p class="speech MAR"> What am I to say to you? Put yourself in my place, and judge what
                I can possibly do. Advise me, dispose of me, I trust myself entirely
                to you, for I am sure that you will never ask of me anything but what
                is modest and seemly.</p> 
                
                <h4 >CLE.</h4> <p class="speech CLE">Alas! to what do you reduce me when you wish me to be guided
                entirely by feelings of strict duty and of scrupulous propriety.</p>
                
                <h4 >MAR.</h4> <p class="speech MAR">But what would you have me do? Even if I were, for you, to divest
                myself of the many scruples which our sex imposes on us, I have too
                much regard for my mother, who has brought me up with great
                tenderness, for me to give her any cause of sorrow. Do all you can
                with her. Strive to win her. I give you leave to say and do all you
                wish; and if anything depends upon her knowing the true state of my
                feelings, by all means tell her what they are; indeed I will do it
                myself if necessary.</p>
                
               <h4> CLE.</h4> <p class="direction">(_aside_)</p><p class="speech CLE">Frosine, dear Frosine, will you not help us?</p>
                
                <h4>FRO.</h4> <p class="speech FRO">Indeed, I should like to do so, as you know. I am not naturally
                unkind. Heaven has not given me a heart of flint, and I feel but too
                ready to help when I see young people loving each other in all
                earnestness and honesty. What can we do in this case?</p>
                
                <h4 >CLE.</h4><p class="speech CLE"> Try and think a little.</p>
                
                <h4>MAR. </h4><p class="speech MAR">Advise us.</p>
